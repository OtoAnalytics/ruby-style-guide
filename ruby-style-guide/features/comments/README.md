* Write self-documenting code and ignore the rest of this section. Seriously!

* Write comments in English.

* Use one space between the leading `#` character of the comment and the text
  of the comment.

* Comments longer than a word are capitalized and use punctuation. Use [one
  space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_spacing) after periods.

* Avoid superfluous comments.

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  counter += 1 # Increments counter by one.
  ```

* Keep existing comments up-to-date. An outdated comment is worse than no comment
  at all.

* Avoid writing comments to explain bad code. Refactor the code to
  make it self-explanatory. (Do or do not - there is no try. --Yoda)
