Here's some tools to help you automatically check Ruby code against
this guide.

### RuboCop

[RuboCop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) is a Ruby code style
checker based on this style guide. RuboCop already covers a
significant portion of the Guide, supports both MRI 1.9 and MRI 2.0
and has good Emacs integration.

### Vim RuboCop
The [Vim RuboCop plugin](https://github.com/ngmy/vim-rubocop) runs RuboCop and displays the results in Vim.

### RubyMine

[RubyMine](http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/)'s code inspections are
[partially based](http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/RUBYDEV/RubyMine+Inspections)
on this guide.
 
### Sublime RuboCop
[Sublime RuboCop](https://github.com/pderichs/sublime_rubocop) is a Sublime Text plugin that runs RuboCop on your Ruby files in the
editor. It will mark issues right inside the view but it can also be
called as a "compiler" from the ST menu.
