* Avoid needless metaprogramming.

* Do not mess around in core classes when writing libraries.
  (Do not monkey-patch them.)

* The block form of `class_eval` is preferable to the string-interpolated form.
  - when you use the string-interpolated form, always supply `__FILE__` and `__LINE__`,
    so that your backtraces make sense:

  ```ruby
  class_eval 'def use_relative_model_naming?; true; end', __FILE__, __LINE__
  ```

  - `define_method` is preferable to `class_eval{ def ... }`

* When using `class_eval` (or other `eval`) with string interpolation, add a comment block
  showing its appearance if interpolated (a practice used in Rails code):

  ```ruby
  # from activesupport/lib/active_support/core_ext/string/output_safety.rb
  UNSAFE_STRING_METHODS.each do |unsafe_method|
    if 'String'.respond_to?(unsafe_method)
      class_eval <<-EOT, __FILE__, __LINE__ + 1
        def #{unsafe_method}(*args, &block)       # def capitalize(*args, &block)
          to_str.#{unsafe_method}(*args, &block)  #   to_str.capitalize(*args, &block)
        end                                       # end

        def #{unsafe_method}!(*args)              # def capitalize!(*args)
          @dirty = true                           #   @dirty = true
          super                                   #   super
        end                                       # end
      EOT
    end
  end
  ```

* Avoid using `method_missing` for metaprogramming because backtraces become messy,
  the behavior is not listed in `#methods`, and misspelled method calls might silently
  work, e.g. `nukes.launch_state = false`. Consider using delegation, proxy, or
  `define_method` instead. If you must use `method_missing`:

  - Be sure to [also define `respond_to_missing?`](http://blog.marc-andre.ca/2010/11/methodmissing-politely.html)
  - Only catch methods with a well-defined prefix, such as `find_by_*` -- make your code as assertive as possible.
  - Call `super` at the end of your statement
  - Delegate to assertive, non-magical methods:

    ```ruby
    # bad
    def method_missing?(meth, *args, &block)
      if /^find_by_(?<prop>.*)/ =~ meth
        # ... lots of code to do a find_by
      else
        super
      end
    end

    # good
    def method_missing?(meth, *args, &block)
      if /^find_by_(?<prop>.*)/ =~ meth
        find_by(prop, *args, &block)
      else
        super
      end
    end

    # best of all, though, would to define_method as each findable attribute is declared
    ```
