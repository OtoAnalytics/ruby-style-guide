* Prefer string interpolation and string formatting instead of string concatenation:

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  email_with_name = user.name + ' <' + user.email + '>'

  # good
  email_with_name = "#{user.name} <#{user.email}>"

  # good
  email_with_name = format('%s <%s>', user.name, user.email)
  ```

* Consider padding string interpolation code with space. It more clearly sets the
  code apart from the string.

  ```Ruby
  "#{ user.last_name }, #{ user.first_name }"
  ```

* Adopt a consistent string literal quoting style. There are two
  popular styles in the Ruby community, both of which are considered
  good - single quotes by default (Option A) and double quotes by default (Option B).

  * **(Option A)** Prefer single-quoted strings when you don't need
    string interpolation or special symbols such as `\t`, `\n`, `'`,
    etc.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    name = "Bozhidar"

    # good
    name = 'Bozhidar'
    ```

  * **(Option B)** Prefer double-quotes unless your string literal
    contains `"` or escape characters you want to suppress.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    name = 'Bozhidar'

    # good
    name = "Bozhidar"
    ```

  The second style is arguably a bit more popular in the Ruby
  community. The string literals in this guide, however, are
  aligned with the first style.

* Don't use the character literal syntax `?x`. Since Ruby 1.9 it's
  basically redundant - `?x` would interpreted as `'x'` (a string with
  a single character in it).

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  char = ?c

  # good
  char = 'c'
  ```

* Don't leave out `{}` around instance and global variables being
  interpolated into a string.

  ```Ruby
  class Person
    attr_reader :first_name, :last_name

    def initialize(first_name, last_name)
      @first_name = first_name
      @last_name = last_name
    end

    # bad - valid, but awkward
    def to_s
      "#@first_name #@last_name"
    end

    # good
    def to_s
      "#{@first_name} #{@last_name}"
    end
  end

  $global = 0
  # bad
  puts "$global = #$global"

  # good
  puts "$global = #{$global}"
  ```

* Don't use `Object#to_s` on interpolated objects. It's invoked on them automatically.

  ```Ruby
  # bad
  message = "This is the #{result.to_s}."

  # good
  message = "This is the #{result}."
  ```

* Avoid using `String#+` when you need to construct large data chunks.
  Instead, use `String#<<`. Concatenation mutates the string instance in-place
  and is always faster than `String#+`, which creates a bunch of new string objects.

  ```Ruby
  # good and also fast
  html = ''
  html << '<h1>Page title</h1>'

  paragraphs.each do |paragraph|
    html << "<p>#{paragraph}</p>"
  end
  ```

* When using heredocs for multi-line strings keep in mind the fact
  that they preserve leading whitespace. It's a good practice to
  employ some margin based on which to trim the excessive whitespace.

  ```Ruby
  code = <<-END.gsub(/^\s+\|/, '')
    |def test
    |  some_method
    |  other_method
    |end
  END
  #=> "def test\n  some_method\n  other_method\nend\n"
  ```
