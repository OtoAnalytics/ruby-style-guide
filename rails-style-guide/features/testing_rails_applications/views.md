* The directory structure of the view specs `spec/views` matches the
  one in `app/views`. For example the specs for the views in
  `app/views/users` are placed in `spec/views/users`.
* The naming convention for the view specs is adding `_spec.rb` to the
  view name, for example the view `_form.html.haml` has a
  corresponding spec `_form.html.haml_spec.rb`.
* `spec_helper.rb` needs to be required in each view spec file.
* The outer `describe` block uses the path to the view without the
  `app/views` part. This is used by the `render` method when it is
  called without arguments.

    ```Ruby
    # spec/views/articles/new.html.haml_spec.rb
    require 'spec_helper'

    describe 'articles/new.html.haml' do
      # ...
    end
    ```

* Always mock the models in the view specs. The purpose of the view is
  only to display information.
* The method `assign` supplies the instance variables which the view
  uses and are supplied by the controller.

    ```Ruby
    # spec/views/articles/edit.html.haml_spec.rb
    describe 'articles/edit.html.haml' do
    it 'renders the form for a new article creation' do
      assign(
        :article,
        mock_model(Article).as_new_record.as_null_object
      )
      render
      rendered.should have_selector('form',
        method: 'post',
        action: articles_path
      ) do |form|
        form.should have_selector('input', type: 'submit')
      end
    end
    ```

* Prefer the capybara negative selectors over should_not with the positive.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    page.should_not have_selector('input', type: 'submit')
    page.should_not have_xpath('tr')

    # good
    page.should have_no_selector('input', type: 'submit')
    page.should have_no_xpath('tr')
    ```

* When a view uses helper methods, these methods need to be
  stubbed. Stubbing the helper methods is done on the `template`
  object:

    ```Ruby
    # app/helpers/articles_helper.rb
    class ArticlesHelper
      def formatted_date(date)
        # ...
      end
    end

    # app/views/articles/show.html.haml
    = "Published at: #{formatted_date(@article.published_at)}"

    # spec/views/articles/show.html.haml_spec.rb
    describe 'articles/show.html.haml' do
      it 'displays the formatted date of article publishing' do
        article = mock_model(Article, published_at: Date.new(2012, 01, 01))
        assign(:article, article)

        template.stub(:formatted_date).with(article.published_at).and_return('01.01.2012')

        render
        rendered.should have_content('Published at: 01.01.2012')
      end
    end
    ```

* The helpers specs are separated from the view specs in the `spec/helpers` directory.
