* Mock the models and stub their methods. Testing the controller should not depend on the model creation.
* Test only the behaviour the controller should be responsible about:
  * Execution of particular methods
  * Data returned from the action - assigns, etc.
  * Result from the action - template render, redirect, etc.

        ```Ruby
        # Example of a commonly used controller spec
        # spec/controllers/articles_controller_spec.rb
        # We are interested only in the actions the controller should perform
        # So we are mocking the model creation and stubbing its methods
        # And we concentrate only on the things the controller should do

        describe ArticlesController do
          # The model will be used in the specs for all methods of the controller
          let(:article) { mock_model(Article) }

          describe 'POST create' do
            before { Article.stub(:new).and_return(article) }

            it 'creates a new article with the given attributes' do
              Article.should_receive(:new).with(title: 'The New Article Title').and_return(article)
              post :create, message: { title: 'The New Article Title' }
            end

            it 'saves the article' do
              article.should_receive(:save)
              post :create
            end

            it 'redirects to the Articles index' do
              article.stub(:save)
              post :create
              response.should redirect_to(action: 'index')
            end
          end
        end
        ```

* Use context when the controller action has different behaviour depending on the received params.

    ```Ruby
    # A classic example for use of contexts in a controller spec is creation or update when the object saves successfully or not.

    describe ArticlesController do
      let(:article) { mock_model(Article) }

      describe 'POST create' do
        before { Article.stub(:new).and_return(article) }

        it 'creates a new article with the given attributes' do
          Article.should_receive(:new).with(title: 'The New Article Title').and_return(article)
          post :create, article: { title: 'The New Article Title' }
        end

        it 'saves the article' do
          article.should_receive(:save)
          post :create
        end

        context 'when the article saves successfully' do
          before { article.stub(:save).and_return(true) }

          it 'sets a flash[:notice] message' do
            post :create
            flash[:notice].should eq('The article was saved successfully.')
          end

          it 'redirects to the Articles index' do
            post :create
            response.should redirect_to(action: 'index')
          end
        end

        context 'when the article fails to save' do
          before { article.stub(:save).and_return(false) }

          it 'assigns @article' do
            post :create
            assigns[:article].should be_eql(article)
          end

          it 're-renders the "new" template' do
            post :create
            response.should render_template('new')
          end
        end
      end
    end
    ```
