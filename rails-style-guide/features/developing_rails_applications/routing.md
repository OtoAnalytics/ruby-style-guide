* When you need to add more actions to a RESTful resource (do you
  really need them at all?) use `member` and `collection` routes.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    get 'subscriptions/:id/unsubscribe'
    resources :subscriptions

    # good
    resources :subscriptions do
      get 'unsubscribe', on: :member
    end

    # bad
    get 'photos/search'
    resources :photos

    # good
    resources :photos do
      get 'search', on: :collection
    end
    ```

* If you need to define multiple `member/collection` routes use the
  alternative block syntax.

    ```Ruby
    resources :subscriptions do
      member do
        get 'unsubscribe'
        # more routes
      end
    end

    resources :photos do
      collection do
        get 'search'
        # more routes
      end
    end
    ```

* Use nested routes to express better the relationship between
  ActiveRecord models.

    ```Ruby
    class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
      has_many :comments
    end

    class Comments < ActiveRecord::Base
      belongs_to :post
    end

    # routes.rb
    resources :posts do
      resources :comments
    end
    ```

* Use namespaced routes to group related actions.

    ```Ruby
    namespace :admin do
      # Directs /admin/products/* to Admin::ProductsController
      # (app/controllers/admin/products_controller.rb)
      resources :products
    end
    ```

* Never use the legacy wild controller route. This route will make all
  actions in every controller accessible via GET requests.

    ```Ruby
    # very bad
    match ':controller(/:action(/:id(.:format)))'
    ```

* Don't use `match` to define any routes. It's removed from Rails 4.
