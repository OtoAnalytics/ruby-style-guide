* Put gems used only for development or testing in the appropriate group in the Gemfile.
* Use only established gems in your projects. If you're contemplating
on including some little-known gem you should do a careful review of
its source code first.
* OS-specific gems will by default result in a constantly changing `Gemfile.lock`
for projects with multiple developers using different operating systems.
Add all OS X specific gems to a `darwin` group in the Gemfile, and all Linux
specific gems to a `linux` group:

    ```Ruby
    # Gemfile
    group :darwin do
      gem 'rb-fsevent'
      gem 'growl'
    end

    group :linux do
      gem 'rb-inotify'
    end
    ```

    To require the appropriate gems in the right environment, add the
    following to `config/application.rb`:

    ```Ruby
    platform = RUBY_PLATFORM.match(/(linux|darwin)/)[0].to_sym
    Bundler.require(platform)
    ```

* Do not remove the `Gemfile.lock` from version control. This is not
  some randomly generated file - it makes sure that all of your team
  members get the same gem versions when they do a `bundle install`.
