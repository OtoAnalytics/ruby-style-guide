* Name the mailers `SomethingMailer`. Without the Mailer suffix it
  isn't immediately apparent what's a mailer and which views are
  related to the mailer.
* Provide both HTML and plain-text view templates.
* Enable errors raised on failed mail delivery in your development environment. The errors are disabled by default.

    ```Ruby
    # config/environments/development.rb

    config.action_mailer.raise_delivery_errors = true
    ```

* Use a local SMTP server like [Mailcatcher](https://github.com/sj26/mailcatcher) in the development environment.

    ```Ruby
    # config/environments/development.rb

    config.action_mailer.smtp_settings = {
      address: 'localhost',
      port: 1025,
      # more settings
    }
    ```

* Provide default settings for the host name.

    ```Ruby
    # config/environments/development.rb
    config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: "#{local_ip}:3000" }


    # config/environments/production.rb
    config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'your_site.com' }

    # in your mailer class
    default_url_options[:host] = 'your_site.com'
    ```

* If you need to use a link to your site in an email, always use the
  `_url`, not `_path` methods. The `_url` methods include the host
  name and the `_path` methods don't.

    ```Ruby
    # wrong
    You can always find more info about this course
    = link_to 'here', url_for(course_path(@course))

    # right
    You can always find more info about this course
    = link_to 'here', url_for(course_url(@course))
    ```

* Format the from and to addresses properly. Use the following format:

    ```Ruby
    # in your mailer class
    default from: 'Your Name <info@your_site.com>'
    ```

* Make sure that the e-mail delivery method for your test environment is set to `test`:

    ```Ruby
    # config/environments/test.rb

    config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :test
    ```

* The delivery method for development and production should be `smtp`:

    ```Ruby
    # config/environments/development.rb, config/environments/production.rb

    config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :smtp
    ```

* When sending html emails all styles should be inline, as some mail clients
  have problems with external styles. This however makes them harder to
  maintain and leads to code duplication. There are two similar gems that
  transform the styles and put them in the corresponding html tags:
  [premailer-rails](https://github.com/fphilipe/premailer-rails) and
  [roadie](https://github.com/Mange/roadie).

* Sending emails while generating page response should be avoided. It causes
  delays in loading of the page and request can timeout if multiple email are
  sent. To overcome this emails can be sent in background process with the help
  of [sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq) gem.
