* Keep the controllers skinny - they should only retrieve data for the
  view layer and shouldn't contain any business logic (all the
  business logic should naturally reside in the model).
* Each controller action should (ideally) invoke only one method other
  than an initial find or new.
* Share no more than two instance variables between a controller and a view.
